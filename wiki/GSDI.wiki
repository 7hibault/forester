#summary generalized speciation duplication inference

= Generalized Speciation Duplication Inference

== Purpose ==

To infer duplication events on a gene tree given a trusted species tree.

== Usage == 
{{{
java -Xmx1024m -cp
path/to/forester.jar org.forester.application.gsdi [-options] <gene tree in phyloXML format> <species tree> [outfile]
}}}

=== Options ===

  *s : to strip the species tree prior to duplication inference
 *  -b: to use SDI algorithm instead of GSDI algorithm
 * -m: use most parimonious duplication model for GSDI: 
     assign nodes as speciations which would otherwise be assiged
     as unknown because of polytomies in the species tree
 * -q: to allow species tree in other formats than
     phyloXML (Newick, NHX, Nexus)



== Details ==

Output consists of three files:
  * input-name_preprocessed_gene_tree.phylo.xml
  * input-name_species_present.txt
  * input-name_removed_nodes.txt
