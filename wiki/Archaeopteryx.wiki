== How to read and display vector or expression data ==

Aptx can be used to display vector or expression data associated with tree nodes:

  # Ensure the configuration file contains this line: "show_vector_data:               display yes"
  # Start Aptx and read in a tree ([http://forester.googlecode.com/files/apaf.xml example tree])
  # Open "Tools" menu and select "read Vector/Expression Values" ([http://forester.googlecode.com/files/apaf_expression.tab example expression values])

It is also possible to store vector data in phyloXML formatted files ([http://forester.googlecode.com/files/apaf_with_vector_data.xml example])
